1. Explain what the calculations above might or might not tell you about the "fairness" of your Naive Bayesian network.

The calculations show that the model may be biased against women. When we leave out gender information, 99.96% of women
are predicted to have a higher chance of earning more than $50K. However, when gender is included, those predictions
drop significantly for women, while predictions for men stay the same. This shows that adding gender information
negatively affects women's predictions but doesn't impact men's, meaning the model is unfair to women.

Moreover, only 8.06% of women are assigned a probability greater than 0.5 of earning over $50K, compared to 25.42% of
men. This disparity suggests the model fails to achieve demographic parity, as the distribution of high-salary
predictions is not equal across genders. The significant difference in probabilities when Gender is included versus
excluded indicates that the model’s predictions are not well separated from gender, violating the criterion of
independence. Additionally, since the actual salaries differ based on gender even when the predicted probabilities
are similar, the model does not meet the sufficiency criterion.

These results suggest that the model has learned gender biases likely present in the training data, highlighting the
importance of ensuring fairness in the data and model-building process.

2. Would you be willing to use your model to recommend starting salaries for employees at a firm? Why or why not?

Given these fairness issues, I would not be willing to use this model to recommend starting salaries for employees at a
firm. The model clearly demonstrates a gender bias, as it predicts significantly lower chances of high earnings for
women compared to men, even when similar evidence is present. Such bias could lead to unequal pay, especially if the
model’s recommendations are used to set initial salaries, which could perpetuate or even exacerbate existing gender
inequalities in the workplace.

Using this model could be considered unethical as it may contribute to ongoing disparities between men and women. It
could also expose the firm to legal liabilities related to discrimination and unequal pay practices, which would harm
both employees and the firm’s reputation. Instead, it would be more responsible to develop a model that ensures
fairness, either by excluding sensitive attributes like gender altogether or by applying fairness-aware machine
learning techniques to mitigate the biases.

To ensure fairness in salary recommendations, the model should be retrained with a focus on addressing historical
biases that may have been present in the training data. The goal should be to promote equal opportunities for all
employees, regardless of their gender or other potentially sensitive attributes.
