class Variable:

class Factor: 
    '''
    Class for defining a a factor.

    The scope of a factor contains an ordered list of variables.
    A factor maps every assignment of values to these variables to a number. 
    If the scope is empty, the factor contains a single number.

    After creating the factor, you can interact with the factor in multiple ways.

    If you interact with the factor using add_values and get_value, 
    then you must provide the list of values in order of the variables
    in the factor's scope.

    If you interact with the factor using 
    add_value_at_current_assignment and get_value_at_current_assignments,
    you must assign the variables using set_assignment, then you can
    set or get the value of the factor. 

    The advantage of the latter approach is that there is no need
    to worry about the order of the variables in the factor. 
    The disadvantage of the latter approach is that you may have to 
    save and restore the values of the variables.

        Afterwards, the factor's values will be initialized accordingly.

        '''This function allows adding values to the factor in a way
        that will often be more convenient. We pass it only a single
        number. It then looks at the assigned values of the variables
        in its scope and initializes the factor to have value equal to
        number on the current assignment of its variables. Hence, to
        use this function one first must set the current values of the
        variables in its scope.

        For example, if 
            scope = [A, B, C],
            A.domain() = [1,2,3], 
            B.domain() = ['a', 'b'], and

            A.set_assignment(1)
            B.set_assignment('a')
            C.set_assignment('heavy')
        then we call add_value_at_current_assignment(0.33) with the value 0.33, 
        we would have initialized this factor to have the value 0.33 
        on the assigments (A=1, B='1', C='heavy')
        This has the same effect as the call 
            add_values([1, 'a', 'heavy', 0.33])

        One advantage of the current_assignment interface to factor values is that
        we don't have to worry about the order of the variables in the factor's
        scope. add_values on the other hand has to be given tuples of values where 
        the values must be given in the same order as the variables in the factor's 
        scope. 

        See recursive_print_values called by print_table to see an example of 
        where the current_assignment interface to the factor values comes in handy.
